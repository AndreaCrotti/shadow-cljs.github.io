== REPL

You can use the command-line utility to connect to a REPL simply by using a running build ID:

.Browser REPL
```
shadow-cljs cljs-repl app
```

.Node REPL
```
shadow-cljs node-repl
```

== Cursive

If you're a Cursive user then you currently need at least a dummy `project.clj` file. You may also wish to
read the

```
(defproject your/project "0.0.0"
  :dependencies
  [[thheller/shadow-cljs "1.0.20170629"]]

  :source-paths
  ["src"])
```

This will allow Cursive to detect the proper source paths for the project.

If you want the full Cursive experience including proper code navigation then you want to use full
<<Leiningen, Leiningen integration>>.

=== Cursive REPL Integration

An <<nREPL>> is created by `shadow-cljs` when it is in development mode. You can connect to it to get
REPL integration using a Clojure Remote REPL run configuration.

By default the network port number is random, but that will be a major pain. You have
two choices:

. Configure the nREPL port
. Use a symlink to get the port into the standard location.

Option 1 is nice because it doesn't require any filesystem interactions:

.NREPL in shadow-cljs.edn
```
{:nrepl {:port 9000}}
```

Option 2 is simple, but involves using the standard nREPL port file, which you may need for other
network REPLs like your server. The port for the `shadow-cljs` REPL is written out to
`target/shadow-cljs/nrepl.port`, so simply symbolically link this file to the standard
`~/.nrepl-port`:

.Using a symbolic link for REPL port
```
ln -sv target/shadow-cljs/nrepl.port .nrepl-port
```

Once you've chosen your option for tracking the port, you can add a run configuration via
`Run -> Edit Configurations...`:

.Clicking on the `+` icon will add a new run configuration.

.Choose a Clojure Remote REPL
image::cursive-repl-2.png[]

In the last step either type in the port you've set in your config, or choose to use the
standard nrepl port:

.If you're using `.nrepl-port`, then configure as shown. If you configured the port number in `shadow-cljs.edn` then use `localhost` and the configured port number.

== CIDER

CIDER support requires the simple combination of having the `cider-nrepl` dependency on your
classpath and configuring nREPL. The entries to `shadow-cljs.edn` are simply:

```
{:dependencies [[cider/cider-nrepl "0.16.0"]]
 :nrepl {:port 8202}

 ...
}
```

then invoke the `cider-connect` function from emacs.

When you connect to the nREPL it will start out in CLJ mode. If you select a running build it should
switch the nREPL session to CLJS.

Internally, it does this either by calling a fake piggieback function or the "official" API:

```
(cemerick.piggieback/cljs-repl :id-of-build)
;; or
(shadow.cljs.devtools.api/nrepl-select :id-of-build)
```

Once connected you should be able to eval code using `C-c C-c` (eval a block), `C-x C-e` (eval sexp),
or `C-c C-k` (eval buffer).

If you see an error like "`cider-load-buffer' needs a ClojureScript REPL", you need to hit
enter once in the repl buffer. Emacs should then recognize that you have a cljs repl buffer and
evals should start working.

NOTE: `shadow-cljs` will automatically add the required `cider-nrepl` middleware when it finds `cider.nrepl`
on your classpath, i.e. in your dependencies.
