== Cursive

Cursive does not currently support resolving dependencies via `shadow-cljs.edn`. You can run `shadow-cljs pom` to generate a `pom.xml` and import that using the IntelliJ.

Alternatively you can create a dummy `project.clj` or use the full <<Leiningen, Leiningen integration>>.

```
(defproject your/project "0.0.0"
  :dependencies
  [[thheller/shadow-cljs "2.0.145"]]

  :source-paths
  ["src"])
```

You can run `npx shadow-cljs server` inside the Terminal provided by IntelliJ and use `Clojure REPL -> Remote` Run Configuration to connect to the provided <<nREPL, nREPL server>>.
